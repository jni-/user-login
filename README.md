User login demo
===============

Very basic demo that illustrates :

* Using spring session attributes
* Some JSP and JSTL
* Log4j
* Basic spring dependency injection

Usage
=====

Use `mvn jetty:run` to start the server, hit http://localhost:8080 and try valid/invalid logins.

Notice the log in the console and in the logins.txt file.
